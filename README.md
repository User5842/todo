# ToDo

We all have things to do and what better way to track them then by creating a ToDo List. Well, since you are all done with the project, let's do something else to continue honing those HTML, CSS and JS skills.

Don't worry too much about the CSS, but instead, focus on creating a clean, readable template and a well formed script file.

There isn't a deadline and I'll be accepting submissions perpetually.

## Prerequisites
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your work.
3. Navigate into the root of the project and install dependencies by running `npm install` via the command line or terminal.
4. Once done, create a pull-request to your main branch (e.g., `main`, `master`, `develop`).
5. Add me as a reviewer (username is [User5842](https://github.com/User5842)).

Make sure to include a README outlining the features of your application.

## User Stories
- User can create a task.
- User can remove a task.
- User can edit a task.
- User can see completed tasks.

## Bonus features
- Add persistence by incorporating localStorage.
- Your app has gone viral and now more people want to use it! Using localStorage, create a mock authentication system so multiple users can "sign up" for your app.
- Allow for different profiles to have different completed and pending tasks.
